                What is the difference between a car wash and car detailing?
              </h2>
              <p>
                A car wash is primarily focused on the exterior surface cleaning
                of the vehicle, often using automated systems or hand washes.
                Car detailing goes much deeper, including both exterior and
                interior cleaning, with attention to detail that restores and
                protects the vehicle.

                How often should I have my car detailed?
              </h2>
              <p>
                It depends on several factors including driving conditions,
                vehicle storage, and personal preference. Generally, a full
                detail is recommended every 6-12 months, with regular washes in
                between.

              <h2 className="font-bold">How long does car detailng take?</h2>
              <p>
                The time can vary based on the vehicle's condition and the level
                of service requested, but typically, a full detail can take
                between 2 to 8 hours.

                Can detailing remove scratces from my car's paint?
              </h2>
              <p>
                Minor scratches and swirl marks can often be removed or greatly
                diminished through polishing during the detailing process.
                However, deep scratches that penetrate the paint may require
                more extensive repairs.

                Prices vary based on the size of the vehicle and the level of
                detail requested. Basic cleanings can start as low as $50 and
                full details with long-lasting protection could cost upwards of

                Absolutely. A well-maintained and detailed car can significantly
                increase its appeal and potentially its resale value, as it

                Paint correction is a process that removes imperfections in a
                vehicle's finish, such as swirls, scratches, oxidation, and
                etching, restoring the paint to its original shine.

                Regular washing with a pH-neutral soap, avoiding harsh
                chemicals, using microfiber towels for drying, and applying a
                quality wax or sealant periodically can help maintain the
